# 🔎 SOFTWARE TESTER PORTFOLIO - Katarzyna Czekaj

## ABOUT ME

<p align="justify">Why did I decide to be a <b>software tester</b>? I am the person in the team who <b>can look critically</b> and at the same time <b>delicately give comments</b> without hurting anyone. This has saved my team a lot of times from presenting a project with mistakes and losing client trust in our professionalism. In my work, I always care about a <b>good atmosphere, high quality</b> and <b>every detail of my tasks.</b> I can find mistakes, but I also appreciate <b>constructive criticism</b>, because it allows me to self-develop. The constant <b>desire for self-development</b> is another advantage of being a tester, which convinced me to choose this career path. During my training process, I have mastered <b>the skills of exploratory testing, testing of websites and mobile applications, writing test cases, reporting defects</b> and <b>creating test reports.</b> I know how to use <b>SQL, Chrome DevTools, Jira</b> and <b>GitHub.</b> The effects can be seen in this repository. My curiosity grows with each new skill and knowledge, I am convinced that <b>I want to go deeper into the world of testing.</b> I am ready to take on new challenges as <b>a member of the development team.</b></p>

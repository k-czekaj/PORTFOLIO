# SOFTWARE TESTER PORTFOLIO

## ABOUT ME

Why did I decide to be a software tester? I am the person in the team who can look critically and at the same time delicately give comments without hurting anyone. This has saved my team a lot of times from presenting a project with mistakes and losing client trust in our professionalism. In my work, I always care about a good atmosphere, high quality and every detail of my tasks. I can find mistakes, but I also appreciate constructive criticism, because it allows me to self-develop. The constant desire for self-development is another advantage of being a tester, which convinced me to choose this career path. During my training process, I have mastered the skills of exploratory testing, testing of websites and mobile applications, writing test cases, reporting defects and creating test reports. I know how to use SQL, Chrome DevTools, Jira and GitHub. The effects can be seen in this repository. My curiosity grows with each new skill and knowledge, I am convinced that I want to go deeper into the world of testing. I am ready to take on new challenges as a member of the development team.
